Sometimes, I want to download some nice music or video from web. Before I knew about youtube-dl, I used to download them through some "Youtube Downloader" sites, but I was not very fond of it. The sites were very inconvenient, since it looked very illegal and had a lot of ads.

[Youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org) is an AV(audio/video) downloading tool based on Python, which has pretty many supports for AV providers.

Although it was good to have a youtube downloader with **no ads**, it was slightly cumbersom to write down all the commands and options for every single download. So, I made a wrapper of youtube-dl, which is more intuitive and easier to use.

## TL;DR

You can download any audio/video file from web by entering the following command.

```zsh
$ youtube_magic
Enter the type of file: mp4
Multiple URLS?(Y/N): N
Enter the URL of video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_mLFHLSULw
[youtube] d_mLFHLSULw: Downloading webpage
[youtube] d_mLFHLSULw: Downloading js player 5799986b
[download] Destination: ~/Movies/youtube-dl/Luciano Pavarotti - O sole mio.mp4
[download] 100% of 10.85MiB in 00:01
```

## Prerequisite

1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2. Any Text Editor (Recommended: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com))

## Youtube-dl

Youtube-dl([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl)) is a software for downloading AV data from web pages. As we can see from the name, quite a lot of features of youtube-dl is related to Youtube, but it can also downlaod from other sources like [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com).

## Installation

Open the terminal and install Youtube-dl.

```zsh
brew install youtube-dl
```

## Shell code

Open the text editor and write down the code below.

```zsh
function youtube_magic() {
    read "filetype?Enter the type of file: "
    read "Multi?Multiple URLS?(Y/N): "

    if [ "$Multi" = "Y" ]
    then
        echo "Write one URL per line. Finish with ctrl+D."
        if [ "$filetype" = "mp3" ]
        then
            youtube-dl -x --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 -a - -o '~/Music/youtube-dl/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
        elif [ "$filetype" = "mp4" ]
        then
            youtube-dl --format mp4 -f best -a - -o '~/Movies/youtube-dl/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
        fi
    elif [ "$Multi" = "N" ]
    then
        read "URL?Enter the URL of video: "
        if [ "$filetype" = "mp3" ]
        then
            youtube-dl -x --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 $URL -o '~/Music/youtube-dl/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
        elif [ "$filetype" = "mp4" ]
        then
            youtube-dl --format mp4 -f best $URL -o '~/Movies/youtube-dl/%(title)s.%(ext)s'
        fi
    else
        echo "Something Broke!"
    fi
}
```

For the explanation... I think I should write them later when I have more time.

Save this file at where you want, with .sh extension. (I saved at ~/.custom_commands.sh)

## Enable Youtube-magic

The code we wrote just before cannot be found by terminal automatically, so we need a mechanism to find and enable it. A simple was is to enable when the terminal starts up.

Currently, MacOS is using zsh as a defalut terminal, and ~/.zshrc saves the code that is executed when the terminal starts.

Open up ~/.zshrc and write the code below.

```zsh
source ~/.custom_commands.sh # location of the shell code
```

Now, when you open the terminal and use the magic word, you can download any music or video you like on the web.

```zsh
youtube_magic
```
