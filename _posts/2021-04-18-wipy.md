## Intro

I was making data sending mechanism for my school project. After reading the digit from elevator screen, Jetson Nano should send the data to Firebase Firestore, which we can see in app real-time. It worked when I run the code, but on the next day it stopped. I wondered why the code terminates and found out that the wifi of our school turns off from 2 a.m to 6 a.m. Loss of internet connection stopped when it tried to connect to Firebase, terminating the entire script. So, I had to write a code that detects the internet connection and automatically connects back after some amount of time.

## Network-Manager

There were some ways to manage internet connection, and I found NMCli ([Network-Manager document by Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/networkmanager)) the best fit for our project. Below is a description of Network-Manager by Ubuntu.

NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices and connections and attempts to keep network connectivity active when available. It manages Ethernet, WiFi, mobile broadband (WWAN) and PPPoE devices while also providing VPN integration with a variety of different VPN services.

###### Installation can be done with script below.

```bash
sudo apt install network-manager
```

###### Initial connection to a wifi network

```bash
nmcli d wifi connect <wifi-name> password <wifi-password>
```

###### Connection and disconnection

```bash
// connect
nmcli con up <wifi-name>

// disconnect
nmcli con down <wifi-name>
```

When you make another connection to a known network with `nmcli d wifi connect`, it makes indices like `<wifi-name>-1, <another-wifi-name>-2`. To reconnect to known network, use `nmcli con up`.

## Implementing NMCli to Python

The original code that reads and sends data to Firebase was wrote in Python, and I wanted to make the code simple as possible with automatic wifi connection funtionallity. In order to achieve it, I tried to execute NMCli inside the Python script.

After some googling, I found out `os.system` is used to execute system script from Python.

###### Executing system commands from Python

```python
import os

os.system("ls -la")
```

Knowing how to execute system commands, it was easy to implement it for NMCli. I created a class that connects to given network name and password.

###### Executing system commands from Python

```python
class WifiConnector():
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.wifi_name = kwargs['wifi_name']
        self.password = kwargs['password']

    def connect(self):
        res = os.system("nmcli con up {}".format(self.wifi_name))
        if res == 0:
            return True
        else:
            raise Exception("Cannot connect to wifi")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    W = WifiConnector(
        wifi_name="mywifiname",
        password="mywifipswd"
    )
    W.connect()
```

We can't use try-catch on os.system since does not raise Exceptions on wrong commands. I manually handled the situation when nmcli terminates with an error code.

## Making an auto wifi connector

The final code contains the sending and reconnecting functionalities. Sender class gets the information about wifi from ```info.<elevator-id>.json```. When the ```run()``` method executes, it automatically tries to reconnect to wifi after 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

```python
class Sender():
... # initializer and other methods
    def run(self):
        W = WifiConnector(
            wifi_name=self.wifi_name,
            password=self.password
        )
        C = Classifier(tflite_path=self.tflite_path)

        while True:
            if self.connected:
                try:
                    while True:
                        current_floor = C.run()
                        self.send(current_floor)
                        time.sleep(0.2)
                except:
                    print("Connection lost")
                    self.connected = False
            else:
                print("Connecting to wifi")
                try:
                    W.connect()
                except Exception as e:
                    print(e)
                    time.sleep(1800)
                else:
                    print("Connected to wifi")
                    self.connected = True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    info_path = 'info.mid-left.json'
    tflite_path = 'model.tflite'
    S = Sender(tflite_path=tflite_path, info_path=info_path)
    S.run()
```

## Conclusion

I wanted to make an automation script for my data sending code. From the above experience with ```os.system```, I learned how to use execute shell commands and manage Exceptions with Python. Also, this was the first time I used python classes in a real project. I was able to write simple code with more readability with classes.
