## Intro

Preparing for a presentation assignment, me and my groupmates came up with an idea of creating an optimizer. As the name implies, **Optimizer** is an algorithm which optimizes each weights of neural network in order to minimize its error. We wanted to understand the inner working of an optimizer and create an new or variation of some sort. We found some good blogs which explained about the mathematics, [link](https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/), and original papers of those optimizers like [this (Adam)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980).

After understanding the mathematics behind the optimizers, we wanted to create one for real - to train a complicated deep learning model with real data. We needed to write code.

## But how?

Although I didn't have any experience of programming optimizers, I used [Keras](https://keras.io) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) before.
